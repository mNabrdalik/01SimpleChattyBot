# 01SimpleChattyBot
This is my first project based on hyperskill java course. It contains several methods:
1. greet - SimpleBot greetings you, introduce itself and and asks for your name
2. remindName - scanner to input your first name, then SimpleBot will answer.
3. guessAge - SimpleBot ask you for 3 numbers(remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7), then you input 3 numbers and SimpleBot will guess your age.
4. count - Type a number and SimpleBot will count from zero to this number.
5. test - SimpleBot ask you about programming knowledge, only answer 2. is correct, if you type wrong, SimpleBot will give you next chance.
6. end - SimpleBot congratulates you. This is the last method.
